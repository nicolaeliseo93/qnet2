 * deliberately re-exposed here: the channel value is the whole point of the
 * resource, and this endpoint is authorized (contacts.view) and consumed by a
 * trusted frontend. Property access bypasses $hidden, so no makeVisible() is
 * needed — this projection IS the conscious, authorized re-exposure.
