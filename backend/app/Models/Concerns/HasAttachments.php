 *     $invoice->attachments;                       // all files owned
 *     $invoice->attachments()->where('collection', 'scans')->get();
 *     $invoice->delete();                          // cascades: rows + binaries
 *
 * Business logic stays in AttachmentService (models remain thin); the trait is
 * just the convenient owner-side surface.
