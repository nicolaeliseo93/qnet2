/**
 * Contract for a single external-system resource migration (spec 0013).
 *
 * A source declares everything about its migration: its registry key/label,
 * its preview column catalogue, how to page the external system read-only
 * (preview) and how to import every page in the background, creating records
 * through the EXISTING domain Services and setting `old_id` post-create
 * (never duplicated creation logic here). The generic MigrationRegistry +
 * MigrationController + RunMigrationJob operate ONLY through this contract —
 * adding a resource is one class + one config line, mirroring
 * App\Tables\TableDefinition / App\Imports\ImportDefinition.
 *
 * Authorization is NOT part of this contract: access to every migrations
 * endpoint is a single hard gate (EnsureSuperAdmin), not a per-resource
 * permission (spec 0013 decision).
 *
 * @phpstan-type MigrationColumn array{id: string, label: string, type: string}
