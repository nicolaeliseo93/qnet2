/**
 * `business-function-members` migration source (spec 0013, extended): the
 * association pass that links people to an already-migrated business function
 * from the FUNCTION side, so it can express BOTH roles the pivot-only junction
 * could not:
 *  - the operators (0..n) -> the `business_function_user` pivot;
 *  - the single responsible/manager -> `business_functions.manager_id`.
 *
 * It re-reads the SAME external `business-functions` endpoint BusinessFunctionsSource
 * consumes (`user_ids` for operators, `manager_id` for the responsible — all
 * EXTERNAL ids), and runs in a later phase once users exist: BusinessFunctionsSource
 * (phase 1) creates the function before any user is migrated, so its own
 * `user_ids`/manager links cannot resolve yet; this source back-fills them once
 * every user has an `old_id` (MigrationOrder phase 3).
 *
 * The links are written directly on the relations (operators via
 * `syncWithoutDetaching` — additive, never dropping members already attached;
 * the responsible via `manager_id`), which is the pivot/relational remap
 * concern spec 0013 assigns to the source. Every reference is remapped via
 * `old_id`; an unresolved one is a non-fatal warning. Re-import is idempotent:
 * a row that changes nothing is skipped, never duplicated.
